# CMake Tutorial
This repository includes source code examples for the CMake Tutorial. Each step is organized in its own subdirectory, serving as a starting point for that particular step. The examples in this tutorial are designed to be progressive, meaning that each step builds upon the complete solution of the previous step.

## Please Note
The current system (PSC) only has CMake version 3.11.4, which limits our progress to Step 4 of the tutorial. To continue my learning, I will search for another Linux OS that provides a newer version of CMake.
