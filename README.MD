# CMake Tutorial

This directory contains source code examples for the CMake Tutorial.
Each step has its own subdirectory containing code that may be used as a
starting point. The tutorial examples are progressive so that each step
provides the complete solution for the previous step.

## Note
PSC only have cmake-3.11.4 so our progress stuck at Step4. I will find another Linux OS to continue my learning.
